## About

This is a IDAPython script i made that finds additional decrypt functions calls based on a user defined memory address and performs the decryption by grabbing the function arguments from a StealC payload. The decryption function is based off a sample that used a XOR encryption for the first layer of it.

Sample SHA256: e4fc16fb36a5cd9e8d7dfe42482e111c7ce91467f6ac100a0e76740b491df2d4
